# Ribx, a CLI tool to navigate the Ribbit Intermediate Bytecode Notation (RIBN)

Every command has the form `ribx <COMMAND> [OPTIONS] <FILE_NAME>`

## Command

Ribx provides a set of commands to perform different actions on the analyzed RIBN.


- ### `decode`
    Decodes the RIBN generated by the Ribbit compiler.  
    Usage: `ribx decode [OPTIONS] <RIBN>`

    #### Arguments:
    `<RIBN>` The raw ribn as a string

    #### Options:
         
      -s, --sym-table
          Include the symbol table in the decoded output

      -f, --output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>  The file where the decoded output will be written
                                       (default is the standard output)

      --indent-level <INDENT_LEVEL>    The indentation level [default: 2]

      -m, --meta <CONFIG>
          Possible values:
          - all:
            Include all the information about the symbol in the decoded output
          - pos:
            Include the absolute position of the symbol in the ribn
          - rel-pos:
            Include the relative position of the symbol in the ribn
          - op-chars:
            Include the characters that encode the operation in the ribn
          - op-bytes:
            Include the byte value that encode the operation in the ribn
          - op-args-chars:
            Include the characters of the arguments that encode the operation in the ribn
          - op-args-bytes:
            Include the byte value of the arguments that encode the operation in the ribn
          - op-arg-type:
            Include the type of the argument of the operation (index or literal)
